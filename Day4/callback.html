    function show(result) {
      document.getElementById("callbk").innerHTML = result;
    }
    
    Cal(5, 5, show); // show is passed as a callback function In this case, callback is the show function, so it's like calling : show(10);

<!-- Notes :

A callback function is a function that is passed as a parameter to another function — and is called inside that function.
the function is passed and then called inside the other function. --> 
<!-- callbacks are great when:

You want to do something after something else finishes.

You're working with events, delays, or asynchronous actions (like when you click a button or load data from a server). -->
<!-- More flexible — You can decide what to do with the result:
Display
Log it in console
Use it in another calculation -->
